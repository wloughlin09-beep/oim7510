"""Lists and records.

Shared by OIM7510 and OIM6301, and used in the session What one row means.

AUTHORING NOTES.

The session is mostly consolidation. Sections 1 to 3 are a second meeting with
what notebook 1 already ran, named this time, and the table there has 11 rows
after the f-string was added on 2026-09-21. Only two things are new, in sections
4 and 5: a record is read by name, and a list of records is a table. Section 6 is
the portfolio. Decided with Zhi on 2026-09-21, against the risk of carrying a room two
weeks into Python past its own footing.

The scaffold cell after section 1's table holds ten comment lines and nothing else, so
`marimo check` reports `empty-cells` on it. That warning is expected: the cell is where a
student writes their own example of each name, in class or at home, and it is the answer
this notebook gives to the seeded-empty-cell question from OIM6301's s02 debrief. Do not
delete it to quiet the lint.

**The drills in section 3 are language exercises, not analysis questions**, and
and five of the eight come from `internal/drafts/quiz-inventory.md`, whose
answers were run on Python 3.14: A19 (the elif that never runs), M10's
accumulator, M11 (append against extend, sort against sorted) and M12
(aliasing). An earlier draft asked business questions about freight and Zhi
rejected the shape: *这些都不像是 python 的题目*. A later one stated them as bare
`nums = [1, 2]`, which he rejected too: *不要生硬的出这些题，可以简单的给出有意义的
背景*. So each drill carries one line of context and its own data, and A to E are
required while F to H are marked. Every check value here was run on 2026-09-21.

The word **reduce** does not appear in student-facing text (Zhi, 2026-09-21): the
fourth move is "turn many into one number". Decision 29 keeps the term internally.

The thirty orders in section 4 are real rows of `data/northwind/orders.parquet`,
OrderID 10248 to 10274 plus the three unshipped orders 11008, 11019 and 11039.
Check values were computed off that parquet and re-run against this file's own
data on 2026-09-21: 827.00 total freight, 3 never shipped.

The portfolio in section 6 is the six holdings from `archive/25fall/slides/
2025fall/python.md` line 826, whose printed total is $116,302.70. Two levels of
one question: the required one is a list of records, which is inside tonight's
reach, and the marked one is Zhi's original, reading `portfolio.csv`. Reading a
file belongs to s07, so in the marked version the agent writes the code and the
student works the four steps. The notebook writes the CSV itself so that no one
loses the exercise to a path.

The four steps are Zhi's, 2026-09-21: write the approach by hand first, then let
the agent solve it, then have the agent explain every detail, then have the agent
set a similar problem.

The keys carry the database's own spelling (`OrderID`, `ShipCountry`), not Python
casing, because s05 onward meets the same columns in the real table.

`hide_code=True` on every markdown-only cell, and every such cell is one call and
nothing else, or its source leaks onto the page.

It imports nothing but marimo, except the one cell in section 6 that writes the
CSV, which uses pathlib from the standard library. No cell in this file raises.

    **How to work with your agent, in every ✏️ section.** The order matters, and it is the
    same order all term.

    1. **Try it yourself first.** If you cannot write the code, write the steps in words.
    2. **Then ask your agent**, and read what it gives you before you keep it.
    3. **If any line of its answer is unclear, ask it to explain that line.** Keep asking
       until you could write the same line tomorrow. An answer you cannot read is not an
       answer you can check.
    4. **Then ask which concepts its answer used**, and find those rows in the table
       below.

    **The course rules for your agent** are a block of text you paste once into marimo's
    **Settings > AI Features > Custom Rules**, and they make it do steps 3 and 4 without
    being asked. Download them from the course site, under Downloads. Nothing here is

    # 3. ✏️ Your Turn

    Five short ones, each a small piece of code with something surprising in it. Every
    one already has its code in a cell, so there is nothing to copy.

    **How to work them**

    - **Run a cell:** click into it and press `Ctrl+Enter`, or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS.
    - **Add a cell:** hover between two cells and click the **+** button, or use the **+**
      at the bottom of the notebook.
    - **Write words instead of code:** add a cell, open its menu (the **⋮** at its right
      edge) and choose **Convert to Markdown cell**. Prose typed into a code cell turns
      the cell red and it stays broken until you convert it or delete it.
    - **`This variable is already defined in another cell`:** you are trying to give a name
      that already exists somewhere else in this notebook. Edit the cell that already has
      it, or pick a different name. marimo allows one definition per name in the whole
      file, which is what stops two cells from quietly disagreeing.
    - **If your number is not the one written under a question**, check your data before
      you check your code. Last week's Experiment 1 put 999.99 into the freight list on
      purpose and asked you to put it back.
    - **Stuck:** try it yourself first, then ask your agent and paste the error if there
      is one. Read its answer, ask it to explain any line you could not have written, and
      finish by asking which concepts it used. The four steps are at the top of this
      notebook.

    ## ✏️ The Orders Table

    Each question is one of the moves from section 2, done to records.

    2. How many orders have **no `ShippedDate`**? That field holds `None` for them, and
       `if order["ShippedDate"] is None:` is how you ask.
    3. Which order has the **largest** freight, and what is it?

    **Check yourself:** 827.00 · 3 · order 10263 at 56.00.

    Then ask your agent, and ask which concepts its answer used.

    **Going further.** Look at the three orders with no `ShippedDate`. What do they have
    in common that the other 27 do not? The answer is not about shipping.

    that part and spend your time on steps 3 and 4.

    # 🚀 This Week's Work

    1. Everything above that is not marked **Advanced**, in this file, in your repository
       under `notebooks/`
    2. Your *One row is...* sentence
    3. Commit as you go, with messages that say what changed, and push before you stop

    **What you can do now:**

    - [ ] I can take one field out of one record, by name
    - [ ] I can state what one row of a table means, in a sentence
    - [ ] I can walk a collection and total the part of it that meets a condition
    - [ ] I can tell a missing value from a zero
    - [ ] I can hand a problem to an agent and check what comes back

    You will do the same things to a pandas table in October and to a database table in
    November.
